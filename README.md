# AWS Shield Advanced Rapid Deployment
Practical and functional code to implement AWS services for DDoS Protection all through automation and with minimal coding required.
Code includes a series of CloudFormation templates with supporting lambda for custom lambda backed resources.  Each module can be deployed stand alone but
has been designed to be deployed as StackSets to protect multiple account(s), OU(s), or an entire AWS Organization and even in multiple regions.

At this time, this code is referenced by a re:Invent Workshop, this repo will be updated with those instructions at a later date.
